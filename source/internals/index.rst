Saffire's internal structure is heavily based on the code of Python. This is for two reasons. First, because of the two
main languages we "adapt" (PHP and Python), the Python's internal structure is the most sane one. Secondly, we quickly
came to the conclusion that lot of idea's we are having, are - in some form or the other - already implement similar in
the Python language. One of the main idea's, working with abstract objects (t_*_object), is quite similar to python's
object structure (PyObject_*). Even though we do a lot of research in both Python and PHP's cores, we simply do not want
to copy everything over 1:1. Afteral, Saffire aims to be a complement to both Python and PHP, and not merely a copy.

However, during the course of development, we tend to move more and more to our own system.
